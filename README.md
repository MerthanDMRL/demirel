Greenhouse
This is the first github experience for me. I am open the feedbacks, thanks.

There is a greenhouse project with arduino for water wasting. 
Dht11, soil moisture sensor and LDR. //sensors
Water pump motor (3-6 VDC), Hot air fan(220 VAC), LED 1m (5VDC). Each component has a different power supply.
There is relay connection in the system. 
also I used OLED screen 128x32 coding with adafruit.
